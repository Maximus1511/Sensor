# Sensor
Hello, my name is Maksim Kryzhanovskii. I am interested in junior java deleveloper job.

This is my 2d PetProject: Sensor
(link to my 1st project: https://github.com/Maximus1511/LocalLibraryProject)

Here i created REST API Service, which can obtain data from "sensor".
For more details see RestServerDescription.txt

I've initialized this project with https://start.spring.io/

Also there is a simple client console application, where user can register new sensor and add
some measurements. Get requests we can do using any browser.
